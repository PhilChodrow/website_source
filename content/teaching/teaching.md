# Approach

My primary aim as a teacher is to make the power of mathematical reasoning and quantitative problem-solving accessible to *all* students. I consistently gather data about my teaching, and use it to assess the accessibility and relevance of my offerings. I am especially interested in the potential for innovative, inclusive teaching techniques to ameliorate race and gender disparities in applied mathematics and data science. 

Some educational techniques I'm excited about include: 

- **Learning micro-communities**. Especially during the isolating time of COVID-19, I aim to build small, persistent groups of students who can offer support and act as witnesses to the learning of their peers. 
- **Flipped classrooms**. The theory is simple: the critical time in a student's learning journey comes when they are actively solving problems. Flipped methodologies allow me to prioritize this active time, while simultaneously giving students flexibility on how my course fits into their schedules. 
- **[Mastery grading](https://www.masterygrading.com/)**. Mastery grading is an assessment methodology that promotes high standards, clear communication, and student control over their journey through the course. *This is a new technique for me,* and I am still learning more. I aim to implement it in PIC16B starting in Fall 2021.
