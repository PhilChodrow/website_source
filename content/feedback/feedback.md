### Disclaimer

This is a *highly curated* subset of feedback I've received from students in both official and self-designed evaluations. I've divided the feedback into broad themes. 

## Course Effectiveness

*This class demanded a lot from us...Overall I feel so proud of what I've been able to accomplish in this class. I feel like I've grown in my abiliites to describe my ideas, communicate my coding thought process, work as a member of a group, time manage, not procrastinate, and approach problems with confidence instead of doubt. Thank you Professor Chodrow, and to all the TAs and LAs who have put so much time and love into this course! I've learned so much and I'm so excited to use it!!!* <br> - PIC16A, Winter '21


*I can't believe I learned so much in the span of 10 weeks!! When I was interviewing for internships I could quote some of the class assignments and people were impressed :)* <br> - PIC16A, Spring '21

*Thank you for igniting the fire in me to pursue programming. Honestly, I entered this class scared because of the lack of coding experience. But in these three months, I ended up loving programming...I feel blessed that I got the opportunity to be in your class* <br> - PIC16A, Fall '20

*...going into this class, I was extremely worried and asking myself why I'm even trying. Thankfully, basically thanks to your doing, I'm leaving this course with a sense of pride about how much I've achieved and learned despite the voice in the back of my mind telling me I can't do it...I'm proud of the progress I've made...* <br> - PIC16A, Fall '20

*This quarter I feel like my coding skills faced a sharp learning curve. Not only did I learn so much, but I also enjoyed what I was doing because I was able to understand it and felt motivated to do so. I think the structure of this class helped me really stay on top of things and not fall behind too often, which was really helpful in the overall experience.* <br> - PIC16A, Winter '21







## Course Environment

*What really made a difference...was your practical and empathetic approach. Actually feeling listened to as a student?? Woah!! Crazy stuff. \[In other courses\] I consistently succeeded grade wise, but was left feeling depleted and mostly uninspired, I think in part due to feeling almost ignored as a student. Now, I have refueled hope and excitement to learn and explore topics from this course in the future.* <br> - PIC16A, Winter '21

*He is so understanding and the first professor to actually get to know my name, and he did this within the span of a few weeks. He is funny, understanding, nice and genuinely resonates with his students....I would have to say he is the best professor I've ever had.* <br> - PIC16A, Fall '20

*I just want to say that both the TA and professor did an amazing job with approaching the students and making them feel comfortable in our learning environment. It made a difficult and complex class a lot less stressful.* <br> - PIC16A, Winter '21

## Learning Communities

*When I first learned that we had to work in small groups twice a week I was a little upset...I was prepared for the worst. But I have to say the discussions were some of my favorite parts of the week...I could have asked for a better group. I am so grateful for these friendships I have made.* <br> - PIC16A, Winter '21

*The best thing about PIC 16A with regards to the class is my group! Discussion sections are one of the highlights of my week! We also have scheduled a time every week where we work together on the homework. It's so refreshing to have contact with new people in these crazy circumstances.* <br> - PIC16A, Fall '20

## Miscellaneous

*Phil is 100% the best professor I've had at UCLA and honestly probably the best teacher I've ever had period. Let him do whatever he wants at UCLA. Heck, make him the department chair. He deserves it.*

\[Editorial note: I'm not sure this student understood what they were wishing on me.\]

*I think this was the course in which I "grew up."* <br> - PIC16B, Spring '21

*Thanks so much for a wonderful quarter! Live Long and Prosper :)* <br> - PIC16A, Fall '20 <br>
\[Editorial note: Star Trek is a running bit throughout the lecture notes.\]



*If I could take every math/PIC class with him, I would in a heartbeat.* <br> - PIC16A, Fall '21
